## Overview of the restaurant project

The purpose of the project is to transform a static webpage to a mobile ready application making sure, along the way, That:
* It is responsive to various screen sizes
* It has accessibility feature for screen reader
* Its contents has been cached for offline use (using service worker script)

### Running The Application On Local Computer

* Download as .zip file or clone this project:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/najeh-halawani/Udacity-Restaurant-Reviews-App.git
    ```
* To run the project locally, I opted the use of python http server. If python is already installed, check for what version it has by typing in a terminal: `python -V`.
*  For version 2.x launch the server using the following command: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8889`. Make sure that this port is not already in use.
*  For version 3.x launch the server using the following command: `python3 -m http.server 8889`.
*  In case Python is not installed, install it from the following link: `https://www.python.org/`
*  Once the server is running, navigate to the local site: `http://localhost:8889` using incognito for better experience  as a suggestion
